# Web Sketches with Three.js and Others

## Overview
This is a repository for storing sketches in the browser by ftd (It also serves as a trial for [Vite](https://ja.vitejs.dev/) & [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)). When adding a directory for a new sketch or template, a link is automatically created on the top page.

## Usage

### Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Development Server
```
npm run dev
```

### Production
```
npm run build
```

### Locally preview production build
```
npm run preview
```

## License
MIT, but many of the sketches also rely on references and assets, so check those as well.
